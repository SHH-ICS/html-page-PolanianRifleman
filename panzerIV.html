        <h1 id="header">Panzer IV</h1>
        <p2>The Panzer IV was the most numerous German tank and the second-most numerous German fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War; 8,553 Panzer IVs of all versions were built during World War II, only exceeded by the StuG III assault gun with 10,086 vehicles. Its chassis was also used as the base for many other fighting vehicles, including the Sturmgeschütz IV assault gun, the Jagdpanzer IV self-propelled anti-tank gun, the Wirbelwind self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, and the Brummbär self-propelled gun.</p2>

        <h2 class="tank">Panzer IV ausf J</h2>
        <p>The Panzer Iv ausf. J began production in 1944 and was a greatly simplified design of the previous model. It no longer had the skirt armor of the H, and was incredibly simplified so it could be cheaper and replace heavy losses that the Germans had at this point of the war.</p>
